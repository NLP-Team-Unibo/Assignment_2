   "source": "# Intro\n\nThis assignment is centred on a particular and emerging NLP task, formally known as **fact checking** (or fake checking). As AI techniques become more and more powerful, reaching amazing results, such as image and text generation, it is more than ever necessary to build tools able to distinguish what is real from what is fake.\n\nHere we focus on a small portion of the whole fact checking problem, which aims to determine whether a given statement (fact) conveys a trustworthy information or not. \n\nMore precisely, given a set of evidences and a fact to verify, we would like our model to correctly predict whether the fact is true or fake.\n\nIn particular, we will see:\n\n*   Dataset preparation (analysis and pre-processing)\n*   Problem formulation: multi-input binary classification\n*   Defining an evaluation method\n*   Simple sentence embedding\n*   Neural building blocks\n*   Neural architecture extension",

   "source": "# The FEVER dataset\n\nFirst of all, we need to choose a dataset. In this assignment we will rely on the [FEVER dataset](https://fever.ai).\n\nThe dataset is about facts taken from Wikipedia documents that have to be verified. In particular, facts could face manual modifications in order to define fake information or to give different formulations of the same concept.\n\nThe dataset consists of 185,445 claims manually verified against the introductory sections of Wikipedia pages and classified as ```Supported```, ```Refuted``` or ```NotEnoughInfo```. For the first two classes, systems and annotators need to also return the combination of sentences forming the necessary evidence supporting or refuting the claim.",

   "source": "## 2.1 Dataset structure\n\nRelevant data is divided into two file types. Information concerning the fact to verify, its verdict and associated supporting/opposing statements are stored in **.jsonl** format. In particular, each JSON element is a python dictionary with the following relevant fields:\n\n*    **ID**: ID associated to the fact to verify.\n\n*    **Verifiable**: whether the fact has been verified or not: ```VERIFIABLE``` or ```NOT VERIFIABLE```.\n    \n*    **Label**: the final verdict on the fact to verify: ```SUPPORTS```, ```REFUTES``` or ```NOT ENOUGH INFO```.\n    \n*    **Claim**: the fact to verify.\n    \n*    **Evidence**: a nested list of document IDs along with the sentence ID that is associated to the fact to verify. In particular, each list element is a tuple of four elements: the first two are internal annotator IDs that can be safely ignored; the third term is the document ID (called URL) and the last one is the sentence number (ID) in the pointed document to consider.\n\n**Some Examples**\n\n---\n\n**Verifiable**\n\n```\n{\"id\": 202314, \"verifiable\": \"VERIFIABLE\", \"label\": \"REFUTES\", \"claim\": \"The New Jersey Turnpike has zero shoulders.\", \"evidence\": [[[238335, 240393, \"New_Jersey_Turnpike\", 15]]]}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Not Verifiable**\n\n```\n{\"id\": 113501, \"verifiable\": \"NOT VERIFIABLE\", \"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"claim\": \"Grease had bad reviews.\", \"evidence\": [[[133128, null, null, null]]]}\n```\n\n---",

   "source": "## 2.2 Some simplifications and pre-processing\n\nWe are only interested in verifiable facts. Thus, we can filter out all non-verifiable claims.\n\nAdditionally, the current dataset format does not contain all necessary information for our classification purposes. In particular, we need to download Wikipedia documents and replace reported evidence IDs with the corresponding text.\n\nDon't worry about that! We are providing you the already pre-processed dataset so that you can concentrate on the classification pipeline (pre-processing, model definition, evaluation and training).\n\nYou can download the zip file containing all set splits (train, validation and test) of the FEVER dataset by clicking on this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wArZhF9_SHW17WKNGeLmX-QTYw9Zscl1/view?usp=sharing). Alternatively, run the below code cell to automatically download it on this notebook.\n\n**Note**: each dataset split is in .csv format. Feel free to inspect the whole dataset!",

   "source": "## 5.1 Handling multiple inputs\n\nThe first thing to notice is that we are in a multi-input scenario. In particular, each sample is comprised of a fact and its asssociated evidence statement.\n\nEach of these input is encoded as a sequence of tokens. In particular, we will have the following input matrices:\n\n*    Claim: `[batch_size, max_tokens]`\n*    Evidence: `[batch_size, max_tokens]`\n\nMoreover, after the embedding layer, we'll have:\n\n*    Claim: `[batch_size, max_tokens, embedding_dim]`\n*    Evidence: `[batch_size, max_tokens, embedding_dim]`\n\nBut, we would like to have a 2D input to our classifier, since we have to give an answer at pair level. Therefore, for each sample, we would expect the following input shape to our classification block:\n\n*   Classification input shape: `[batch_size, dim]`\n\n**How to do that?**\n\nWe inherently need to reduce the token sequence to a single representation. This operation is formally known as **sentence embedding**. Indeed, we are trying to compress the information of a whole sequence into a single embedding vector.\n\nHere are some simple solutions that we ask you to try out:\n\n1.   Encode token sequences via a RNN and take the last state as the sentence embedding.\n\n2.  Encode token sequences via a RNN and average all the output states.\n\n3.  Encode token sequences via a simple MLP layer. In particular, if your input is a `[batch_size, max_tokens, embedding_dim]` tensor, the matrix multiplication works on the **max_tokens** dimension, resulting in a `[batch_size, embedding_dim]` 2D matrix. Alternatively, you can reshape the 3D input tensor from `[batch_size, max_tokens, embedding_dim]` to `[batch_size, max_tokens * embedding_dim]` and then apply the MLP layer.\n\n4.   Compute the sentence embedding as the mean of its token embeddings (**bag of vectors**).",

All models can be thought as:\n\n1. Input\n2. (word) Embedding\n3. Sentence embedding\n4. Multiple inputs merging\n5. Classification\n\n---\n\n**Question**: Can I extend models by adding more layers?\n\n**Answer**: Feel free to define model architectures as you wish, but remember satisfy our requirements. This assignment should not be thought as a competition to achieve the best performing model: fancy students that want to show off but miss required assignment objectives will be punished!!\n\n---\n\n**Question**: I'm struggling with the implementation. Can you help me?\n\n**Answer**: Yes sure! Contact us and describe your issue. If you are looking for a particular type of operation, you can easily check the documentation of the deep learning framework you are using (google is your friend).\n\n---\n\n**Question**: Can I try other encoding strategies or neural architectures?\n\n**Answer:** Absolutely! Remember to try out recommended neural baselines first and only then proceed with your extensions.\n\n---\n\n**Question**: Do we have to test all possible sentence embedding and input merging combinations?\n\n**Answer**: Absolutely no! Feel free to pick one sentence embedding strategy and try all possible input merging strategies with it! For instance, pick the best performing sentence embedding method and proceed with next steps (extras included). Please, note that you still have to implement all mentioned strategies!\n\n---\n\n**Question**: I'm hitting out of memory error when training my models, do you have any suggestions?\n\n**Answer**: Here are some common workarounds:\n\n1. Try decreasing the mini-batch size\n2. Try applying a different padding strategy (if you are applying padding): e.g. use quantiles instead of maximum sequence length\n3. Check the efficiency of your custom code implementation (if any)\n4. Try to define same length mini-batches to avoid padding (**It should not be necessary here!**)\n\n---\n\n**Question**: I'm hitting CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM error! What I'm doing wrong?\n\n**Answer**: This error is a little bit tricky since the stack trace is not meaningful at all! This error occurs when the RNN is fed with a sequence of all 0s and pad masking is enabled (e.g. from the embedding layer). Please, check your conversion step, since there might be an error that leads to the encoding of a sentence to all 0s.\n\n---",
